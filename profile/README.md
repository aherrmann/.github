# Bazel Contributors

This org is governed by a [Bazel] community group.
It is not owned or maintained by Google.

It is the home of the Bazel Rules Authors Special Interest Group (SIG),
see https://github.com/bazel-contrib/SIG-rules-authors

In the future it's possible that other groups may want to share this org with us, such as:

- Remote Execution
- Windows support
- Editors

Come chat with us in https://slack.bazel.build in `#rules` if you'd like to participate in bazel-contrib outside of the Rules Authors SIG.
